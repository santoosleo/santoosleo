ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

I'm @santoosleo, a Brazilian student who's diving into the world of Python. My aspiration is to contribute to Open-Source Public Projects and pursue programming in a home office setup.
At 22, I've been immersed in the fascinating realm of computers since I was 13, always driven by a curiosity to understand how things, particularly electronics, operate. I staunchly advocate for open, public, and free software.
I navigate between Windows (out of necessity) and Linux (out of passion), occasionally dabbling in building a hackintosh for the sheer enjoyment of it.

ðŸ“« How to get in touch? While I'm currently not active on social media to concentrate on my studies, you can reach me via WhatsApp, which I prefer not to disclose for obvious reasons.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, studying, honing my English skills, programming, and binge-watching my favorite series.

That's about it! I'm looking forward to the opportunity to collaborate on some exciting public repositories here.
